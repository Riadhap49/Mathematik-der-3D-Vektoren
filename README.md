# Mathematik-der-3D-Vektoren
Some Theorie about 3D Vectors.

● This a wpf mvvm app, designed to have some fun with 3D vectors. 
● Basic theorie on vectors: 
   -How should we define a 3D vector?
   -Is the vector immutable or not?
   -What about the hashcode for every vector and how it get build?
● Some operations applied on 3D vector in a helper class
● Helper class for resolving a DependencyProperty.
● Validation class specialize the ValidationRule class for validate the user's input. 
● Some xaml code define the view with 3 userControls form the main window.
  -Libraries like materialDesign and metro mah
released in one library used for more nice feautures in Design.
● Unit-Test methods using MSTest V2.2.10 with some attributes
[DataTestMethod] [DataRow] [DynamicDataRow]
  - Extension for Assert class with a method 
get used by calling the "That" keyword in the Assert structure.

REMARQUE: it's about the cross product and NOT about the addition of two vectors :) ( u ll find something like VectorSum or addition dont worry, its the cross product) sorry for my mistake...
